# Chicago Crime Data


This repo contains a data set from the Chicago Police department for crimes committed between 2001 to 2023 (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim). This project is dedicated to doing some cool data analysis and visualization on this already curated dataset.

Data visualizations were created through the super awesome Python library **folium**, which I highly recommend to make beautiful map visualizations.

Descriptions of each map visualization is shown below:

- `map/January-2023-chicago-crimes.html` : This map is a detailed map visualization of all the crimes commited so far in the month of March (March 1, 2018 to March 19, 2018), with popup markers that display more information about each individual map, such as date, time, location, crime type, and crime description.
  
- `map/January-2023-chicago-crime-heatmap.html` : This map contains a heat map of all crimes commited so far in the month of March (March 1, 2018 to March 19, 2018).
  
- `map/Crime-per-district-choropleth.html` : This map contains a choropleth map of all the crimes from 2001 to 2023 based on Chicago Police District

Also, here is the nbviewer for my jupyter notebook to see all visualizations : [Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/bilalfatian/Chicago-Crime-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Chicago-Crime-Data-Analysis.ipynb)
